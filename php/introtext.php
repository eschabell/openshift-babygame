The baby game is back! You can enter your guess (as many guesses as you like!) for the birth date of the next 
<?php print FAMILYNAME; ?> family addition. The official due date is <?php print DUEDATE; ?>. Just kidding, 
we are running this application here as a live demo for OpenShift! ;-)

Enjoy the fun and good luck!
