<p>
The baby game is back! You can enter your guess (as many guesses as you like!) for the birth date of the next 
<?php print FAMILYNAME; ?> family addition. The official due date is <?php print DUEDATE; ?>. Each guess will be registered 
costs one euro. All proceeds go to the baby's future schooling fund. You will be contacted by us for payment in the future.
<p>
The winner will receive a gift (not the proceeds!) of extream interest. If there is no clear winner then the 
closest guess will receive a 'booby prize.' All winners and final decisions rest with the head council in the 
<?php print FAMILYNAME; ?> family.
<p>
Enjoy the fun and good luck!
